Docker is one of best virtualization tools to run any container without any struggle. This blogs does not explain anything about docker and docker-compose, just a collection of docker-compose script to running database such as postgresql, mysql, sqlserver, and mongodb with some basic configuration. You can copy and running in you machine. All docker-compose file will be setup with `.env` file, so it can be modify easily. Let's begin with PostgreSQL.

## Postgre SQL

PostgreSQL is one of the best SQL Database, and it is Open Source. It has been used by numerous organizations, if you know [supabase](https://supabase.com/), they use postgresql for the database. Here the docker-compose to run postgresql:

```yaml
version: "3"

networks:
  postgres:
    name: ${DB_CONTAINER:-postgres}

volumes:
  db:
    name: ${DB_CONTAINER:-postgres}

services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:alpine
    container_name: ${DB_CONTAINER:-postgres}
    restart: always
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=${DB_USERNAME:-postgres}
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD:-secret}
      - POSTGRES_DB=${DB_DATABASE:-postgres}
    volumes:
      - db:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
    networks:
      - postgres

  pgweb:
    image: "sosedoff/pgweb"
    container_name: pgweb
    ports:
      - "8082:8081"
    networks:
      - postgres
    environment:
      - SESSIONS=1
      - LOCK_SESSION=TRUE
      - DATABASE_URL=postgres://${DB_USERNAME:-postgres}:${DB_PASSWORD:-secret}@${DB_CONTAINER:-postgres}:5432/${DB_DATABASE:-postgres}?sslmode=disable
    depends_on:
      - postgres
```

You can modify anything from database secret to docker volumne name. To do so, create `.env` file in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml` file, and add the required environment varibale with your desired value.

```
DB_CONTAINER="docker-container-name"

DB_DATABASE="yourdatabasenname"

DB_USERNAME="yourdatabaseuser"

DB_PASSWORD="yourdatabasepassword"
```

For instance, the line `POSTGRES_DB=${DB_DATABASE:-postgres}` utilizes `DB_DATABASE` variable from the environment variable file (`.env`) to set the `POSTGRES_DB`, and if the variable does not exist, it defaullt to `postgres`.

You might have noticed another service named [`pgweb`](http://sosedoff.github.io/pgweb/), it's a simple and minimal web tools build in go to manage postgresql database that you can deploy on your machine. It is optional, but I personally use this tool while developing anything with PostgreSQL."

## MySQL

It's not complete when you talk about database without mentioning MySQL. Which is one of the most popular SQL Databases. Here is an example of the `docker-compose` file to run MySQL:

```yaml
version: "3"

networks:
  mysql:
    name: ${DB_CONTAINER:-mysql}

volumes:
  mysql_data:
    name: ${DB_CONTAINER:-mysql}

services:
  mysql:
    image: mysql:latest
    command: --default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password
    container_name: ${DB_CONTAINER:-mysql}
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=${DB_ROOT_PASSWORD:-rootpassword}
      - MYSQL_USER=${DB_USERNAME:-yourusername}
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD:-yoursecret}
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=${DB_DATABASE:-yourdatabase}
    ports:
      - 3307:3307
    volumes:
      - mysql_data:/var/lib/mysql
    networks:
      - mysql
```

the `command` attributes allows you to add some options to the default MySQL configuration, for example you want to use `mysql_native_password` as authentication plugin instead of `caching_sha2_password` (the default authentication plugin for MySQL 8.0 or higher). Additionally, you can change the default encoding to UTF-8 (`--character-set-server=utf8mb4 --collation-server=utf8mb4_unicode_ci`), and any other options that MySQL supports. MySQL by default need root password, and you need to specify one of the following as an environment variable:

- `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`, to add root password
- `MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD`, to use empty password for root user (not recommended)
- `MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD`, set to `yes` or `true` to use random generated password. The generated root password will be printed to stdout.

For the `.env` file, you can use this example

```
DB_CONTAINER="docker-container-name"

DB_ROOT_PASSWORD="your root db password"

DB_DATABASE="yourdatabasenname"

DB_USERNAME="yourdatabaseuser"

DB_PASSWORD="yourdatabasepassword"
```

## SQL Server

SQL Server is SQL Database fdeveloper by Microsoft. SQL Server in Docker was introduced in versions 2017, 2019, and 2022 using Ubuntu-based images. Before 2017, you must install it manually in windows

```yaml
version: "3"

volumes:
  sql-server:
    name: ${DB_CONTAINER:-sql-server}

services:
  sql-server:
    container_name: sql-server
    image: mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest
    ports:
      - "1433:1433"
    environment:
      - MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD:-password}
      - ACCEPT_EULA=Y
    volumes:
      - sql-server:/var/opt/mssql
```

The different SQL Server compared to MySQL and PostgreSQL, SQL Server needs you to accept their EULA 😄, and use `sa` or sysadmin user instead of `root` 😄. To use that `docker-compose` file, create `.env` file like this

```
DB_CONTAINER="sql-server"

DB_PASSWORD="db_password"
```

## MongoDB

MongoDB is different from the previous three databases. MongoDB is NoSQL (Not Only SQL) database that have collections and text documents containing name-value pairs, respectively. Here the script to run mongodb in docker-compose

```yaml
version: "3"

volumes:
  mongo:
    name: ${DB_CONTAINER:-postgres}

services:
  mongodb:
    container_name: mongo
    image: mongo:latest
    ports:
      - 27017:27017
    volumes:
      - mongo:/data/db
    environment:
      - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=${DB_USERNAME:-mongo}
      - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD:-mongo}
```

Like the other databases, create `.env` file and add the following variables

```
DB_CONTAINER="container-name"

DB_USERNAME="yourdatabaseuser"

DB_PASSWORD="yourdatabasepassword"
```

To connect to mongodb database that we created, you can use apps like [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass), and use connection string like this `mongodb://<username>:<password>@localhost:27017/`

## Conclusion

That's it, we discussed the setup of various popular databases using Docker and Docker Compose. We covered PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, and MongoDB. Hope this help you 😄
